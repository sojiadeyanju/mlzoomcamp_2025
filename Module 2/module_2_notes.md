### **Summary: Machine Learning for Regression - Car Price Prediction**

This session provides a hands-on, end-to-end walkthrough of building a linear regression model to predict car prices using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. The project follows a structured machine learning workflow, emphasizing data preparation, exploratory analysis, model training, validation, and evaluation.

#### **1. Data Preparation **
- The dataset (`data.csv`) is downloaded from a GitHub repository.
- It is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.
- Initial inspection with `df.head()` reveals columns such as `make`, `model`, `year`, `engine_hp`, `msrp` (target variable), etc.
- To standardize column names for easier coding, all column names are converted to lowercase and spaces are replaced with underscores using:
  ```python
  df.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')
  ```
- A list of categorical columns is identified using `df.dtypes` to distinguish between object (string) and numerical (int/float) types.

#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) **
- For each column, the unique values and their count are examined using `df[col].unique()` and `df[col].nunique()`.
- The target variable, `msrp` (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price), is analyzed. Its distribution is found to be **long-tailed**, meaning most cars are inexpensive, but a few luxury/exotic cars have very high prices.
- To make the distribution more suitable for linear regression, a **logarithmic transformation** is applied:
  ```python
  price_logs = np.log1p(df.msrp)
  ```
  This transforms the skewed distribution into a more bell-shaped (Gaussian-like) curve, which is better for modeling.
- Missing values are checked with `df.isnull().sum()`. Significant missing data is found in `market_category` (over 3700 records), `engine_hp`, and `engine_cylinders`.

#### **3. Setting Up the Validation Framework **
- The dataset is split into three parts: **Training (60%)**, **Validation (20%)**, and **Test (20%)** sets.
- To ensure randomness, the indices are shuffled using `np.random.shuffle(idx)` before splitting.
- The splits are created using `iloc` for positional indexing, and then reset with `reset_index(drop=True)` for clean, sequential indices.
- The target variable (`msrp`) is also transformed using `np.log1p()` for all three sets.

#### **4. Linear Regression Fundamentals **
- The core concept of linear regression is introduced: predicting a target `y` as a weighted sum of features `x_i` plus a bias term `w0`:
  \[
  \hat{y} = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + ... + w_n x_n
  \]
- The process is demonstrated with a simple example using a single car's features (e.g., engine HP, highway MPG, popularity).
- The vector form is explained, where predictions are computed via the dot product of the feature matrix `X` and weight vector `w`: `y_pred = X @ w`.

#### **5. Training the Model **
- The **Normal Equation** is used to find the optimal weights `w` without iterative optimization:
  \[
  w = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
  \]
- In code, this involves:
  1. Adding a column of ones to `X` to account for the bias term.
  2. Computing the Gram matrix `XTX = X.T.dot(X)`.
  3. Computing its inverse `XTX_inv`.
  4. Calculating `w_full = XTX_inv.dot(X.T).dot(y)`.
- The bias `w0` and feature weights `w` are then separated from `w_full`.

#### **6. Baseline Model **
- A baseline model is trained using only 5 numerical features: `['engine_hp', 'engine_cylinders', 'highway_mpg', 'city_mpg', 'popularity']`.
- Missing values in these features are filled with 0 for simplicity.
- The model is trained on the training set, and predictions are made on the same set.

#### **7. Model Evaluation with RMSE **
- The **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is defined as:
  \[
  \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
  \]
- A function `rmse(y, y_pred)` is implemented to calculate this metric.
- The RMSE on the training set is calculated to establish a baseline performance.

#### **8. Validating the Model **
- The same preprocessing and prediction steps are applied to the **validation set**.
- The RMSE on the validation set is calculated to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
- A helper function `prepare_X(df)` is created to encapsulate the feature selection and missing value handling logic.

#### **9. Feature Engineering **
- A new feature, `age`, is created by subtracting the car's `year` from 2017 (the maximum year in the dataset): `df['age'] = 2017 - df['year']`.
- This new feature is added to the model, replacing `year`. The model is retrained, and the RMSE on the validation set is recalculated, showing improvement.

#### **10. Handling Categorical Variables **
- Categorical variables like `make`, `model`, and `vehicle_style` are encoded using **one-hot encoding**.
- For each categorical column, a dictionary `categorical` is built, mapping the column name to a list of its unique values (from the training set).
- Dummy variables are created for each category (e.g., `num_doors_2d`, `num_doors_4d`) and added to the feature set.
- The model is retrained with these additional features, leading to a significant drop in RMSE.

#### **11. Regularization **
- When many categorical features are added, the feature matrix can become ill-conditioned (e.g., if columns are nearly linearly dependent), causing numerical instability and large, erratic weights.
- **Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)** is introduced to solve this. A small value `r` (lambda) is added to the diagonal of the Gram matrix `XTX`:
  ```python
  XTX = XTX + r * np.eye(XTX.shape[0])
  ```
- This stabilizes the solution and prevents overfitting by penalizing large weights.

#### **12. Tuning the Model **
- The regularization parameter `r` is tuned by testing multiple values (e.g., `[0, 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]`).
- For each `r`, the model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set using RMSE.
- The value of `r` that yields the lowest validation RMSE is selected as the best hyperparameter (in this case, `r=0.001`).

#### **13. Using the Final Model **
- The final model is trained on the combined **training + validation** set to maximize the amount of data used.
- The model is then evaluated on the **test set** to get an unbiased estimate of its real-world performance.
- A single car from the test set is selected, its features are prepared, and a price prediction is made.
- The predicted log-price is converted back to the original scale using `np.expm1()` to show the actual dollar amount.

#### **14. Summary and Next Steps **
- Key takeaways from the session include:
  - Importance of EDA and handling missing values.
  - Transforming the target variable for better model performance.
  - The necessity of a validation framework to avoid overfitting.
  - Implementing linear regression from scratch using NumPy.
  - The power of feature engineering (adding `age`, one-hot encoding).
  - The critical role of regularization in preventing numerical instability.
- Future steps suggested include experimenting with more features and applying the same techniques to other datasets, such as predicting house prices using the Boston dataset.
