🧩 Predicting Customer Churn with Logistic Regression: My ML Zoomcamp 2025 Module 3 Journey

In Module 3 of ML Zoomcamp 2025, I learned how machine learning can help businesses anticipate customer behavior — specifically, predicting who’s likely to churn. This module introduced me to the world of classification models, feature importance, and the logic behind logistic regression. It wasn’t just about building a model — it was about understanding how data tells a story about loyalty, risk, and human behavior.

💼 The Project: Predicting Customer Churn
The goal of this module’s project was clear — identify customers likely to stop using a service before they actually do.
We used a Kaggle dataset with historical customer information and built a binary classification model that outputs a probability of churn for each user.
If the likelihood is high, the company can send personalized discounts or promotions to retain that customer.
In formula terms, it’s represented as:
𝑔(𝑥𝑖) = 𝑦𝑖
Where 𝑦𝑖 ∈{0,1} — with 0 meaning not churning and 1 meaning churning.
This real-world use case made me appreciate how machine learning directly supports customer retention strategies.

🧹 Step 1: Data Preparation
The first step was all about cleaning and structuring data for modeling.
Using Pandas, I learned to:
Lowercase column names
Replace spaces with underscores
Convert yes/no answers into binary (1/0) values
Handle missing data with fillna()
These transformations may seem small, but they’re essential for consistency and preventing model errors.

🧮 Step 2: Setting Up the Validation Framework
We split the data into training and test sets using Scikit-Learn’s train_test_split.
This ensured our model could generalize to unseen data — a critical part of building trust in predictions.
It was also the first time I used Scikit-Learn’s validation tools instead of manual splits, which streamlined the workflow.

🔍 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before modeling, we explored the data to understand patterns and distributions.
EDA revealed:
The overall churn rate
The balance between categories
Which numerical or categorical variables might influence churn
Using commands like:
df.isnull().sum()
df.x.value_counts(normalize=True)
I could visualize imbalances and decide which features might be meaningful later.

📊 Step 4: Measuring Feature Importance
This part was fascinating — discovering what makes customers leave.
🔹 Churn Rate and Risk Ratio
By comparing the churn rate across categories, we saw which groups were more likely to leave.
A risk ratio > 1 indicated higher churn likelihood, while <1 meant the opposite.
🔹 Mutual Information
From information theory, mutual information measures how much one feature tells us about another.
Here, it told us how strongly each feature related to churn.
🔹 Correlation Coefficient
For numerical features, correlation revealed whether variables moved together or inversely.
Positive correlation → churn increases with the feature
Negative correlation → churn decreases with the feature
These insights made me realize that feature analysis isn’t just technical — it’s storytelling through data.

⚙️ Step 5: One-Hot Encoding
Categorical variables needed conversion into numbers before modeling.
We used Scikit-Learn’s DictVectorizer() to perform One-Hot Encoding, turning each category into its own binary feature.
For example, “Contract Type: Month-to-Month” became a new column with 1 or 0 values.
This expanded our feature set while preserving the meaning behind categories.

📈 Step 6: Logistic Regression — The Core of Classification
Then came the main event — Logistic Regression.
It’s similar to linear regression but designed for binary outcomes.
Instead of predicting a continuous value, it predicts a probability between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function:
Sigmoid(z)= 1/1+e−z
This simple mathematical curve makes logistic regression powerful for tasks like churn prediction, fraud detection, and customer segmentation.

🧠 Step 7: Training and Evaluating the Model
Using Scikit-Learn’s LogisticRegression() class, we trained the model and tested it on validation data.
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
pred = model.predict(X_val)
Then we evaluated performance using accuracy — the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes.
The validation and test results were close, meaning the model generalized well.

🔍 Step 8: Model Interpretation
By inspecting the model coefficients, we learned which features most influenced churn.
For example, higher tenure or long-term contracts often reduced churn probability, while month-to-month plans increased it.
It was eye-opening to see business logic reflected mathematically in model weights.

🚀 Step 9: Using the Model
Finally, we retrained the model on the combined training + validation sets and made predictions on the test data.
The accuracy remained consistent, confirming the model’s reliability.
This phase completed the full ML lifecycle — from raw data to actionable insights.

💡 My Key Takeaways
✨ Classification makes data actionable. It transforms probabilities into decisions businesses can act on.
✨ Feature importance tells a story. Data reveals who’s likely to churn and why.
✨ Logistic regression is both elegant and practical. It’s one of the simplest yet most powerful models for binary prediction.

🔭 What’s Next
Next up: Module 4 — Evaluation Metrics 🎯
I’m looking forward to diving deeper into how we measure model performance beyond simple accuracy — like precision, recall, and AUC.

🧭 Final Thoughts
This module made me appreciate the human side of machine learning.
Behind every churn score is a customer’s story — and data helps us tell it before they walk away.

If you’re learning ML, ML Zoomcamp is the perfect bridge between theory and real-world problem-solving.
